## 📦 Building for Production

You can generate a completely static website (HTML files) to save your annotations forever or share them.

### Option A: One-Click Build (Recommended)
Simply double-click the `build_site.bat` file in the project root.
*   ✅ Cleans previous builds.
*   ✅ Generates new static files.
*   ✅ Reports status.

### Option B: Manual Build
```bash
bun run build
```

The generated files will be inside the `dist/` folder.

### ⚠️ How to use the `dist` folder
The `dist` folder contains a static website.
- **Do NOT open `index.html` directly**: Browsers block features when opening files dynamically (`file://` protocol).
- **To view locally**: Run `bun run preview`. This starts a small local server to view the `dist` content.
- **To host online**: You can upload the contents of `dist` to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
